/*
 * Combined reducer for all state-slices
 *
 * Redux state is organised into domains, entities, and ui-related state
 *
 * The `entities` sub-tree is used a little like a NoSQL database to record
 * the main entities the application is concerned with: Tasks, Orders,
 * Restaurants, Couriers, etc.
 *
 * The `ui` sub-tree stores state fragments related only to the appearance
 * of the UI, and which have no impact or relation to the `entities`.
 *
 * The `app` sub-tree stores state fragments that are non-domain specific,
 * like the server URL, or a flag indicating the WS connection status.
 *
 * Initial state-shapes are provided in each individual reducer file.
